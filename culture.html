            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With over a century since its founding, it is no surprise that Silliman University has a rich culture and along with it, traditions and events mainly held in the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium. Silliman University's culture also includes the Silliman University Culture and Arts Council (CAC), the Anthropology Museum, and the Mariano C. Lao Global Studies Center.

                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; As a traditional event held for all freshmen going to silliman, getting cooked under the heat of the sun for an hour straight was not what I had in mind but then again, as far as tradition goes, it must be memorable. In this event, my only motivation to stay was the free ice cream at the end, so it wasn't all too bad. 
                </p><br>
                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Because of this event, I had properly learned the smell of slow roasted humans. This event allowed me to meet other people and even learn all the different college courses that silliman offers. However, I’ll definitely remember this event due to the ice cream at the end due to the fact that me and my friends had a taste of all the flavors available apart from the mango flavor which we couldn’t get due to us getting full from eating ice creams.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; This event was held immediately after the CCS Esports event but I made it in time to watch the parade until it reached the end near the gym where the acquaintance party was being held. The parade consisted of almost all the departments of Silliman but no College of computer studies. Though there were some CCS in DOST Scholars. The parade line was quite long despite some departments not being there, a lot had flashy setups and gimmicks and one person from the psychology department even wore a clown costume which definitely gave some a traumatic repercussion
            </p><br>
            <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; Because of this event, I had learned that there were no torches or fire involved and simply was just a parade. Though one can argue flashlight from phones are considered torches, I beg to differ as all my life these were called flashlights or lights, although there’s no denying that regular torches are a hazard to the community and therefore, should be avoided, it was still definitely a shock not to see any fire around.

                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; At the end of the parade of lights was the stage at Ravello field with stalls surrounding the center stage. We stayed for an hour to visit the stalls and watch the events. Me and some CCS friends ate dinner there while listening to the other departments introduce themselves as well as listen to BINI songs.
                </p><br>
                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; Overall an estimated 3000 students in 1 place is definitely a lot despite the space being big and some people not being present, but because of this event, I had definitely learned the size of Silliman and the amount of students it hosts, although I could not reach the foam party, I’ll definitely see what I can do in my second year where I can freely go at any time I want. I also did not have any extra clothes with me so it was definitely a lost cause.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; For this event, it would be my first time as a working committee member. For the first day, I manned behind the screen to play the zumba for the participants to follow. The event lasted an hour each day and it allowed those who participated to warm up for the day. For this event, I didn’t really learn much apart from new zumba videos to recommend to people. Although I arrived 30 minutes late for the second day and didn’t have the opportunity to log in, it was still fun to participate.
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Because of this event, while I did'nt get sufficient technical skills, I did come across several new Zumba routines that I could recommend to others. It was fascinating to explore the variety of high-energy and creative Zumba styles that help keep fitness enjoyable and accessible.

                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Definitely a very interesting event to host since students have a lot on their plates and need a way to deal with the stress. I am not one of those students, at least I hope I won’t be one of those students. For the movie nights, everyone was allowed entry from any departments with the ticket costing P20 each. Pretty affordable in my opinion as a lot of students are broke. 
                </p><br>
                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; The movies shown were Gonjiam asylum, Inside out 2 and Deadpool and Wolverine. My role during these events was in the technical side. There weren’t that many people who showed up, but then again, everyone was busy during Hibalag week. I didn’t really learn much but that was enjoyable. I definitely want this tradition to continue down the line of CCS.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; One of the cultures of Silliman University that showcases the different courses but also along with other universities, the different courses battled it out through a cheer and a dance competition upon reaching the Cimafranca field. I have seen students not just from Silliman University but also band members from Foundation University, NORSU and St. Paul University who were also part of the parade
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; I was part of the parade as one of the banner people so there wasn’t much I did besides being part of chanting and cheering while walking with other CCS students. Thankfully, the route was mostly not under the heat of the sun so it wasn’t too hot but I am pretty sure someone has fainted. Because of this event, I had learned not to overshoot events because I had signed up before my culture points had maxed out.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; One of the events for our Ge6, Kuwerdas Filipinas is the first semi-professional symphonic rondalla featuring 50 members in the concert tour. Immediately after entering the Luce auditorium, I noticed the abundance of the instrument bandurria. Almost half the orchestra were musicians playing this 16 stringed instrument, and it is understandable as the orchestra was Filipino themed. The rondalla showcased 13 songs with 2 additional songs after the show with 15 songs total. 
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; The rondalla itself was like a 3 course meal, with the first 6 songs being the appetizer, followed by the main course featuring the voice of the soprano, Stefanie Quintin, and the last 3 songs being the dessert with 2 additional songs being the cherry on top. The rondalla went on even through a storm, some were hesitant to go due to the storm and I was one of them. However, the show itself was a treat. My favorite song from the show would probably be the final song “Tropiko”, although this was not included in the main songs.
