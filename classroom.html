                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; The orientation gave us CCS Students insights to the current trends of web development. The first lecture had one of the speakers named Sir Cornelio and the next lecture had ate Sheen from Miller Solutions Inc and they taught us the current trend as well as User experience and User input designs. They were very fun to listen to especially Sir Cornelio, because he incorporated his slides with entertaining memes that we could understand. All the CCS students were present in the room from all levels including professors in the CCS department and apparently even some from different schools.
                </p><br>
                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp;  I was in the technical job in this orientation so I was in the room at 7 in the morning to set up the projector for the event. It was early because it was an event immediately after the CCS opening devotion I definitely did not know what I was allowed to do as the director of CCS Council told me I didn't have to sign up because I was on technical duty. Because of this activity, I had learned to be aware of what my roles were in events but more importantly I was able to know different tactics for web development including mostly about artificial intelligence. For me, we as programmers should use everything we know at our disposal hence why the use of AI for help is inevitable and is currently happening right now.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; This was held in the same room as all other events during this day which was the ATA hall. I had reached the supreme being level upon winning 5 times and losing 2 times in a game of rock, paper, scissors and my team had won a game of dragon on the last game. 50 students who were able to sign up days prior were present at the event and my takeaway was that the event taught us that college isn’t as easy as high school and that socializing is a must.
            </p><br>
            <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; Thankfully I had known people who signed up as well so that was not a problem. Though one can survive on his/her own if he/she is specially gifted, it is still a waste not to meet new people because it is these people who will help you when you struggle. Therefore, I had learned to enjoy this while it lasts as this is my last few years of school where I could meet these amazing people.

                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; This event has taught us a new term(for some) which is big data and IoT. The guest speaker was Mr. Abraham Johannes T. Tourbier, who graduated BSIT in 2021. Personally, I knew about the Internet of things beforehand but big data is a term I have not once heard in the past. I’ve heard about data before as it is common knowledge for anyone encountering anything computer related. So because of this event, I can proudly say that I now know what big data is and how it can be applied to humanity’s innovation.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; In this event, I didn’t think I would be in the working committee but 10 minutes in the event in an ice breaker portion, I was asked to help with the sounds and technical so I accepted. It was worth it because I have been given a tote bag for my assistance after the event. There were a few difficulties during the event but me and Baxter solved it until it worked even if it was not the right solution. But due to this, I learned the term “if it works, it works”.
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; The event featured the BLIS students in their cosplays as characters from famous books. The event had an online talk through gmeet with a guest but the most fun part was definitely the games portion. For some of the games, I have no idea what it was called but memorable ones would be 4 groups stuffing their cheeks with marshmallows and attempting to say red riding hood, one game was shooting balls through hoops and one game had participants dance to wednesday addams famous dance from the movie. Overall, this event gave me one thought question and that is why there are only a few BLIS students. Completely unrelated but then again, I haven't even seen a BSIS student and I only had 1 blockmate enrolled in BLIS.

                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; I was present as technical in both sessions. Both sessions were similar in discussions. I was the only technical in the morning and JD Maxino helped in the afternoon. The AVT people were very chill and even gave me the passwords to their wifi. Now I plan on collecting all the wifi passwords of each department of Silliman University.
