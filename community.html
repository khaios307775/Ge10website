                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; An event organized by my fellow freshmen with one being a neighbor of mine, our goal for this was to donate and give a feeding to an orphanage called Friendship homes - Diocese of Dumaguete inc. in Valencia. Although the outreach was organized for school work, the work was definitely from the heart. However, I plan on doing similar work in the future which is not made for a requirement but just to help people. This was held in the afternoon after ROTC and during which there was a parade downtown. For the event, we donated supplies like food and gifts to the orphanage. I was assigned to give a gift to Ria Joy Palomar who was a 3 year old girl. She didn't speak much but liked to smile.
                </p><br>
                <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Because of this event, I will make it a goal of mine to organize more community events in the future, even after ge10 is done as to not make it an excuse to be organizing events for the sake of points for grades.

        <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; A stepping stone for the goal of helping out the community. This was the first community event I had the opportunity to organize, and it was a rewarding experience. There were no papers to organize this event as it was simply voluntary, We believed that what mattered was the action but we did email the supervisor of Richwood homes giving the green light to organize the event. Together with Ms. Dollen Gabutan, we aimed to bring joy to the children in our area through a feeding program and gift-giving activity. The event was held right outside our house, creating a welcoming and familiar space for the children to gather and celebrate. Given the timing of the event during the Halloween season, we added a festive touch by encouraging the kids to come dressed in costumes, which brought vibrant energy and excitement to the occasion.
        </p><br>
        <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; We extended beyond just our immediate neighborhood. Children from both inside and outside Richwood Homes were invited, and it was heartening to see so many little ones eager to participate. The event was more than just distributing food and gifts; it was a chance to create a sense of community and belonging among the children. To make the day even more enjoyable, we organized party games for the children to have fun. The smiles on their faces were the greatest rewards for all the effort we put into hosting the event.
        </p><br>
        <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; As I recalled making it my goal to help out the community after being part of the orphan outreach, I am planning on hosting more community events in the future.
        </p><br>
        <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Because of this event, I will continue on my path of helping people out in the future. Seeing the children being shy at first and having fun during the games, I will probably plan on hosting a similar event in the future when I am financially stable.

            <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; This community event was organized to support the Dumaguete Animal Sanctuary in their mission to care for animals in need, and it was a wonderful opportunity to contribute to a meaningful cause while having fun. The main highlight of the event was the dodgeball tournament, where I was lucky enough to be part of the winning team, Dodgebol2. Our team included myself, Bon Gamo, Zach Ignacio, Rainier de Castro, Joshua Entea, and John Gabriel(Mog) from Computer Engineering. The majority of people in the event were CCS but the event brought together people and scholars from different departments such as CAS BS Biology and Physics, as well as BS Psychology.
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; I was added to the team at the very last minute, just the night before the event. As a result, I had no idea that there was a color theme for the team, that's why I was the only one wearing a green jacket/red shirt. The team was built to win, my initial goal, like Mogâ€™s, was simply to have fun and enjoy the experience. Winning wasnâ€™t something I had anticipated, but the team was competitive excluding me and Mog. Bon was the mvp in the event, his throws were very strong and hard to catch, mostly due to him being in the baseball team.
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; I had almost forgotten the point of the event which was supporting the Dumaguete Animal Sanctuary but I had fun playing dodgeball. Though it does make it better knowing that our participation contributed to helping animals in need gave the event a sense of purpose that extended beyond the competition.
            </p><br>
            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Because of ths event, I met new people and had fun but most importantly being able to help out for the community.
