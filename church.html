        <p class="info">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Silliman university is a christian centered institution and as such, the church is a primary focus for Silliman University as it was founded with the idea of being a God centered institution. It is worth noting that to show respect during church events, selfies as proof were rarely used.

                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; The event was the first of the day, starting at 8 am until 9 am. It was definitely the same as a mass though shorter  and the objective of the event was our devotion to God. Me and the entirety of the Computer studies department have learned a new meaning of CCS as a listener and that is to Commit all your activities to the lord, Connect to the lord in prayer and to Surrender all the glory to God alone. Though it was already a given for me to give my life and glory to the lord alone, because of this activity, it gave me a wider range of insights to my goals in the future with God

I go to any catholic church nearby every sunday so the procedure is almost always the same, with the key difference being in the scriptures or gospel readings. The church I mostly go to which is nearby is the church located near Valencia public plaza but sometimes when there is an event in central dumaguete, I go to the cathedral located in downtown Dumaguete.

            <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; Held in Dumaguete boulevardâ€™s pantawan area, this event is free to all. During the event, worship songs were played. Although the information said it was to start at 5pm, the event actually started much later than that. I was nearby so I stopped by but had to go home at 7 because it was getting late. Not much can be said for this event though as I could relate it to a concert.

        <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; The first church event me and a blockmate/neighbor named Ms. Dollen Gabutan organized. These were a church service held in the morning and a bible study in the evening. We held this at the front of Ms. Dollen Gabutan's hourse and it started at 6 in the evening and ended at 7: 30 with a meal. For this event, we invited Sr. Pastor Rigel Lou B. Libo-on from the Church of God in Yeshua HaMashiach International. He was accompanied by 2 people who played the guitar. For the event, a few CCS students and some neighbors were present with the main theme of the bible study being our experiences in relation to our favorite verses. We each took turns sharing our verses and talked with the pastor. The main thing to be learned during this was to always trust the lord in everything you do, though in all honesty, that was always the case for me.

            <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; An event required for our CHS1 subject. Originally planned to be held in front of the Silliman Church but the heavy rain throughout the whole day prevented that from happening, so it was transferred to the 4th floor of Ausejo Hall. The sudden downpour was not anticipated and even our professor said there was no chance for rain which probably jinxed it. Anyway the event started with a trust test in which we students each took a turn to place our hand inside a bag without knowing what was inside. Then we portrayed the David and Goliath story with a lecture and afterwards were given bread for snacks. Due to this event, I had learned not to be too sure of the future due to present evidence. The rain was probably jinxed because a lot of people were sure it would not rain at all.
