                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; For this event I was a facilitator along with 7 other members of the sports committee, the process was the same with each team up against each other in a best of 3. Although it was a clean sweep for all winning teams scoring 2-0, we never reached the 3rd game but maybe the semi-finals will be able to get 3 games each. I mostly just watched both teams but I was in charge of team Samantutay Esports who was against team 315. Team Samantutay was the winner of 2 games as they were a strong team.
                </p><br>
                <p class ="reflection"> &emsp; The semi finals round was a complete sweep as well with no 3rd round battles for all teams, Samantutay esports have won and are going to go against MADZ esports for the final rounds. Itâ€™s gonna be interesting to see who wins in the finals. I have my bets on Samantutay esports, because I was in charge of facilitating them and because I am biased. During the finals, MADZ all stars dominated scoring 3-0 against Samantutay esports, it is a bit sad to see the team I was rooting for to lose but then again, it was a fair game.

Me, Joshua Entea, Zachary Ignacio and Rain de Castro went to spectate the games as one of the players was related to Rain. Unfortunately we were only able to watch the first game as it was getting late but the winner for the first game is Brgy. Taclobo. Brgy. Taclobo was very good at defense but also scored consistently with number 29 shooting the majority of 3 pointers.

            <p class = "reflection"> &emsp; Miss Dallen Gabutan worked with the event organizers and allowed us to work as a committee to give out snacks for the players. There's not much to say for this but the key thing that stood out was the venue for spikeball being so far away from central Dumaguete. Either way, we worked as a committee from 8 in the morning to 10 AM. It was definitely tiring, especially because just yesterday was ROTC and so because of this event I had embedded in my mind to take a rest sometimes and immediately after the event, I went back to sleep.

I watched the volleyball finals for women with our playing coach in volleyball Rafael Maghinay during which the blue team won. Aside from that, Me and my friends also watched the mobile legends tournament and the volleyball mens. Because of these events, particularly, the ones held in SU gym, it would be pressuring having a lot of people watch while we play volleyball for intrams next year.
